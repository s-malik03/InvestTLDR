other to \noffer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently \noffer. these markets are characterized by aggressive price competition, \nfrequent product introductions, evolving

company\u2019s future financial condition and operating results depend on \nthe company\u2019s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative \nproducts and services in each of the markets in which it competes. the \ncompany believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the \nentire solution including the hardware (ios devices, mac, apple watch \nand apple tv), software (ios, macos, watchos and tvos), online services \nand distribution of digital content and applications (digital content \nand services). some of the company\u2019s current and potential competitors \nhave substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and \nservices at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the \ncompany\u2019s offerings.supply of componentsalthough\n most components essential to the company\u2019s business are generally \navailable from multiple sources, certain components are currently \nobtained from single or limited sources. in addition, the company \ncompetes for various components with other participants in the markets \nfor mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. \ntherefore, many components used by the company, including those that are\n available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could \nmaterially adversely affect the company\u2019s financial condition and \noperating results.the\n company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its \ncompetitors, and new products introduced by the company often utilize \ncustom components available from only one source. when a component or \nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist \nuntil the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has \nincreased. if the company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing \nproduct were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner \ndelayed shipments of completed products to the company, the company\u2019s \nfinancial condition and operating results could be materially adversely \naffected. the company\u2019s business and financial performance could also be\n materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain \nsufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and \nobtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued \navailability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be\n affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common\n components instead of components customized to meet the company\u2019s \nrequirements.the\n company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; \nhowever, there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to \nextend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. therefore,\n the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages \nand price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial\n condition and operating results.substantially\n all of the company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing \npartners that are located primarily in asia, with some mac computers \nmanufactured in the u.s. and ireland. a significant concentration of \nthis manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of \noutsourcing partners, often in single locations. certain of these \noutsourcing partners are single-sourced suppliers of components and \nmanufacturers for many of the company\u2019s products. although the company \nworks closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, \nthe company\u2019s financial condition and operating results could be \nmaterially adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to\n meet their production commitments. the company\u2019s manufacturing purchase\n obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.research and developmentbecause\n the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid\n technological advances, the company\u2019s ability to compete successfully \ndepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow \nof competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. \nthe company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing \nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through \nr&d, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of \nthird-party businesses and technology.intellectual propertythe\n company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property \nrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories,\n software and services. this includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, \nservice marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property \nrights in the u.s. and a number of foreign countries. although the \ncompany believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is \nan important factor in its business and that its success does depend in \npart on such ownership, the company relies primarily on the innovative \nskills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 5the\n company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations \narising from its research, development and design, and is currently \npursuing thousands of patent applications around the world.\u00a0over \ntime, the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, \nincluding utility patents, design patents and others.\u00a0the company \nalso holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and \nservices. no single intellectual property right is solely responsible \nfor protecting the company\u2019s products. the company believes the duration\n of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the \nexpected lives of its products.many\n of the company\u2019s products are designed to include intellectual property\n obtained from third parties. it may be necessary in the future to seek \nor renew licenses relating to various aspects of the company\u2019s products,\n processes and services. while the company has generally been able to \nobtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there\n is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on \nreasonable terms or at all. because of technological changes in the \nindustries in which the company competes, current extensive patent \ncoverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible \nthat certain components of the company\u2019s products, processes and \nservices may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual \nproperty rights of others. from time to time, the company has been \nnotified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual\n property rights of third parties.foreign and domestic operations and geographic dataduring 2018, the company\u2019s domestic and international net sales accounted for\u00a037% and\u00a063%,\n respectively, of total net sales.\u00a0gross margins on the company\u2019s \nproducts in foreign countries and on products that include components \nobtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign \ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade \nregulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties.business seasonality and product introductionsthe\n company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first \nquarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to \nseasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can \nsignificantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. \nproduct introductions can also impact the company\u2019s net sales to its \nindirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new \nproduct inventory following a product introduction, and channel \ninventory of a particular product often declines as the next related \nmajor product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when \nconsumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, \nneither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product \nintroductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company\u2019s \nfuture pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial \nperformance.warrantythe\n company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware \nproducts. the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date \nof purchase by the original end user. the company also offers a 90-day \nlimited warranty on the service parts used to repair the company\u2019s \nhardware products. in certain jurisdictions, local law requires that \nmanufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by \nstatute, typically at least two years. in addition, where available, \nconsumers may purchase app or ac+, which extends service coverage on \nmany of the company\u2019s hardware products.backlogin\n the company\u2019s experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any \nparticular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business \nprospects. in particular, backlog often increases immediately following \nnew product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. backlog is \noften reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. \nbecause of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable \nindicator of the company\u2019s ability to achieve any particular level of \nrevenue or financial performance.employeesas of september\u00a029, 2018, the company had approximately 132,000 full-time equivalent employees.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 6available informationthe\n company\u2019s annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, \ncurrent reports on form 8-k, and amendments to reports

\n10-k.the\n business, financial condition and operating results of the company can \nbe affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, \nincluding but not limited to those described below, any one or more of \nwhich could, directly or indirectly, cause the company\u2019s actual \nfinancial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, \nor from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. \nany of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and \nadversely affect the company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating \nresults and stock price.because\n of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the \ncompany\u2019s financial condition and operating results, past financial \nperformance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of \nfuture performance, and investors should not use historical trends to \nanticipate results or trends in future periods.global\n and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the \ncompany\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and \ngrowth.the\n company has international operations with sales outside the u.s. \nrepresenting a majority of the company\u2019s total net sales. in addition, a\n majority of the company\u2019s supply chain, and its manufacturing and \nassembly activities, are located outside the u.s. as a result, the \ncompany\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and \nregional economic conditions.adverse\n macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or \nrecession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary \npolicy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and \ncurrency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the \ncompany\u2019s products and services. in addition, consumer confidence and \nspending could be adversely affected in response to financial market \nvolatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and \nmortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel \nand other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic \nfactors. in\n addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company\u2019s products, \nuncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic \nconditions could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s suppliers, \ncontract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular \nnetwork carriers and other channel partners. potential effects include \nfinancial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations \nand purchases of the company\u2019s products; and insolvency.a\n downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased \ncredit and collectibility risk on the company\u2019s trade receivables; the \nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; \nlimitations on the company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced \nliquidity; and declines in the fair value of the company\u2019s financial \ninstruments. these and other economic factors could materially adversely\n affect the company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial \ncondition and growth.global\n markets for the company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive \nand subject to rapid technological change, and the company may be unable\n to compete effectively in these markets.the\n company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive \nglobal markets characterized by aggressive price competition and \nresulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of \nnew products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry \nstandards, continual improvement in product price/performance \ncharacteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by \ncompetitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and \nbusinesses.the\n company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its \nability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new\n products, services and technologies to the marketplace. the company \nbelieves it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire \nsolution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, \nnumerous software applications and related services. as a result, the \ncompany must make significant investments in r&d. there can be no \nassurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the \ncompany may not be able to develop and market new products and services \nsuccessfully.the\n company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights \nand has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, \ntrademarks and service marks. in contrast, many of the company\u2019s \ncompetitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and \nvery low cost structures, and emulating\u00a0the company\u2019s\u00a0products\n and infringing on\u00a0its\u00a0intellectual property. if the company \nis unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with \nattractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company\u2019s \nintellectual property, the company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive \nadvantage could be adversely affected.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 8the\n company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet \nand personal computer markets. the company faces substantial competition\n in these markets from companies that have significant technical, \nmarketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established \nhardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. in \naddition, some of the company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, \nlower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. \ncompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have \naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. certain competitors\n may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide \nproducts at little or no profit or even at a loss.additionally,\n the company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to \nimitate the company\u2019s product features and applications within their own\n products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer \nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the\n company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to\n imitate the company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly \nwithin their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer \nintegrated solutions.some\n of the markets in which the company competes, including the market for \npersonal computers, have from time to time experienced little to no \ngrowth or contracted. in addition, an increasing number of \ninternet-enabled devices that include software applications and are \nsmaller, simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete\n with some of the company\u2019s existing products.the\n company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from \ncompanies that have significant resources and experience and have \nestablished service offerings with large customer bases. the company \ncompetes with business models that provide content to users for free. \nthe company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party \ndigital content and applications.the\n company\u2019s financial condition and operating results depend \nsubstantially on the company\u2019s ability to continually improve its \nproducts and services in order to maintain their functional and design \nadvantages. there can be no assurance the company will be able to \ncontinue to provide products and services that compete effectively.to\n remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must \nsuccessfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products \nand services.due\n to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in \nwhich the company competes, the company must continually introduce new \nproducts, services and technologies, enhance existing products and \nservices, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded \nproducts and services and successfully manage the transition to these \nnew and upgraded products and services. the success of new product and \nservice introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not \nlimited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the \ncompany\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new product \nproduction ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for \nnew products, the effective management of purchase commitments and \ninventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the \navailability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs\n to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services \nmay have quality or other defects or deficiencies. accordingly, the \ncompany cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product \nand service introductions and transitions.the company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.the\n company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, \nwholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products \nfrom competing manufacturers. the company also sells its products and \nthird-party products in most of its major markets directly to education,\n enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and \nmid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores.some\n carriers providing cellular network service for iphone offer financing,\n installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the \ndevice. there is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all \nor in the same amounts upon renewal of the company\u2019s agreements with \nthese carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new \ncarriers.the\n company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance\n reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with \ncompany employees and contractors, and improving product placement \ndisplays. these programs could require a substantial investment while \nproviding no assurance of return or incremental revenue. the financial \ncondition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop \ndistributing the company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for\n some or all of the company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce \ntheir ordering and marketing of the company\u2019s products.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 9the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.the\n company records a write-down for product and component inventories that\n have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost \nexceeds net realizable value. the company also accrues necessary \ncancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. \nthe company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at \nits suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment \nwhenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be \nrecoverable. if the company determines that an impairment has occurred, \nit records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value \nof the asset exceeds its fair value. although the company believes its \ninventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and \npurchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be \ngiven that the company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and\n other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product \nobsolescence in the industries in which the company competes.the\n company orders components for its products and builds inventory in \nadvance of product announcements and shipments. manufacturing purchase \nobligations cover the company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing \nrequirements, typically for periods up to 150 days.\n because the company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to \nrapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will \nforecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts\n of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase \ncommitments.future\n operating results depend upon the company\u2019s ability to obtain \ncomponents in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.because\n the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited\n sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing \nrisks. many components, including those that are available from multiple\n sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and \nsignificant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially \nadversely affect the company\u2019s financial condition and operating \nresults. while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of\n many components, there can be no assurance that the company will be \nable to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \ncomponent suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can\n lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a \nparticular industry, further limiting the company\u2019s ability to obtain \nsufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. \nthe effects of global or regional economic conditions on\u00a0the \ncompany\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201cglobal\n and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the \ncompany\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and \ngrowth\u201d above, also could affect the company\u2019s ability to obtain components. therefore,\n the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages \nand price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial\n condition and operating results.the\n company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from \nonly one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, \ninitial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have \nmatured or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability \nof these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for\n any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on \nthe production of common components instead of components customized to \nmeet the company\u2019s requirements. if the company\u2019s supply of components \nfor a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an \noutsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the \ncompany, the company\u2019s financial condition and operating results could \nbe materially adversely affected. the company\u2019s business and financial \nperformance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the\n time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source,\n or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative \nsource.the\n company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical \nservices provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located \noutside of the u.s.substantially\n all of the company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by \noutsourcing partners located primarily in asia. a significant \nconcentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small \nnumber of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. the company \nhas also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management.\n while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce \nthe company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. such \ndiminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity\n of products or services, or the company\u2019s flexibility to respond to \nchanging conditions. although arrangements with these partners may \ncontain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may \nremain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of \nproduct defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or \nwarranty liability. while the company relies on its partners to adhere \nto its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier \ncode of conduct could occur.the\n company relies on single-sourced outsourcing partners in the u.s., asia\n and europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on \noutsourcing partners primarily located in asia, for final assembly of \nsubstantially all of the company\u2019s hardware products. any failure of \nthese partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company\u2019s \ncost or supply of components or finished goods. in addition, \nmanufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final \ndestinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but \nnot limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology \nsystem failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, \nbusiness, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or \ninternational trade disputes.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 10the\n company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which \nis held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments\n to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply \nagreements. while these arrangements help ensure the supply of \ncomponents and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or \nsuppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in \ntheir business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and\n the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments \ncould be negatively impacted.the\n company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by \ndesign and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect \nthe company\u2019s business and result in harm to the company\u2019s reputation.the\n company offers complex hardware and software products and services that\n can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. sophisticated \noperating system software and applications, such as those offered by the\n company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the \nintended operation of hardware or software products. defects may also \nexist in components and products the company purchases from third \nparties. component defects could make the company\u2019s products unsafe and \ncreate a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. \nthese risks may increase as the company\u2019s products are introduced into \nspecialized applications, including healthcare. in addition, the \ncompany\u2019s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to \ntime experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. as a result, the \ncompany\u2019s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet \ncustomer expectations. there can be no assurance the company will be \nable to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software \nand services it offers. failure to do so could result in widespread \ntechnical and performance issues affecting the company\u2019s products and \nservices. in addition, the company may be exposed to product liability \nclaims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of \ninventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and \nsignificant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and \nregulatory fines. quality problems could also adversely affect the \nexperience for users of the company\u2019s products and services, and result \nin harm to the company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor\n market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in \nnew product and services introductions and lost revenue.the\n company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not \nbe available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.the\n company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital \ncontent to customers. this includes the right to sell currently \navailable music, movies, tv shows and books. the licensing or other \ndistribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively \nshort terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these \narrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. some third-party content \nproviders and distributors currently or in the future may offer \ncompeting products and services, and could take action to make it more \ndifficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise \ndistribute their content in the future. other content owners, providers \nor distributors may seek to limit the company\u2019s access to, or increase \nthe cost of, such content. the company may be unable to continue to \noffer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable \nusage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. failure to \nobtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to \nmake such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have\n a material adverse impact on the company\u2019s financial condition and \noperating results.some\n third-party digital content providers require the company to provide \ndigital rights management and other security solutions. if requirements \nchange, the company may have to develop or license new technology to \nprovide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able \nto develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a \ntimely manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose\n and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its \ndigital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content \nand subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements \nwith the company\u2019s content providers.the company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.the\n company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware \nproducts depend in part on the availability of third-party software \napplications and services. there is no assurance that third-party \ndevelopers will continue to develop and maintain software applications \nand services for the company\u2019s products. if third-party software \napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the \ncompany\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the company\u2019s \nproducts.the\n company believes the availability of third-party software applications \nand services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 \nperception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, \nmaintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company\u2019s \nproducts compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as android for \nsmartphones and tablets and windows for personal computers. this \nanalysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the \ncompany and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated,\n expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing \nsuch applications and services.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 11the\n company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and \npersonal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop\n or upgrade software for the company\u2019s products and more inclined to \ndevote their resources to developing and upgrading software for \ncompetitors\u2019 products with larger market share. if developers focus \ntheir efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality\n of applications for the company\u2019s devices may suffer.the\n company relies on the continued availability and development of \ncompelling and innovative software applications for its products. the \ncompany\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid \ntechnological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or \nchoose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications\n might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer \nexperiences or might not operate correctly and may result in \ndissatisfied customers.the\n company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products \nthrough the app store, mac app store and tv app store. the company \nretains a commission from sales through these platforms. if developers \nreduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and\n offer in-app purchases to customers, then the volume of sales, and the \ncommission that the company earns on those sales, would decrease.the\n company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which \nmay not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or \nat all.many\n of the company\u2019s products include third-party intellectual property, \nwhich requires licenses from those third parties. based on past \nexperience and industry practice, the company believes such licenses \ngenerally can be obtained on reasonable terms. there is, however, no \nassurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable \nterms or at all. failure to obtain the right to use third-party \nintellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on \ncommercially reasonable terms, could preclude the company from selling \ncertain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse \nimpact on the company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.the\n company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, \nsuch as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.the\n company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have \narisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully \nresolved, and new claims may arise in the future. in addition, \nagreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification\n provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the \nevent of a claim against an indemnified third party.claims\n against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or \nother violations of intellectual property rights have generally \nincreased over time and may continue to increase. in particular, the \ncompany has historically faced a significant number of patent claims \nrelating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in \nthe future. for example, technology and other patent-holding companies \nfrequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into \nlitigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other \nviolations of intellectual property rights. the company is vigorously \ndefending infringement actions in courts in a number of u.s. \njurisdictions and before the u.s. international trade commission, as \nwell as internationally in various countries. the plaintiffs in these \nactions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.regardless\n of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time \nconsuming, disruptive to the company\u2019s operations and distracting to \nmanagement. in recognition of these considerations, the company may \nenter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle \nlitigation and resolve such disputes. no assurance can be given that \nsuch agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation \nwill not occur. these agreements may also significantly increase the \ncompany\u2019s operating expenses.except\n as described in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k in the notes to \nconsolidated financial statements in note 9, \u201ccommitments and \ncontingencies\u201d under the heading \u201ccontingencies,\u201d in the opinion of \nmanagement, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company \nmay have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a \nrecorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal \nand other claims, including matters related to infringement of \nintellectual property rights.the\n outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. if one or more legal \nmatters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party \nin a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s \nexpectations, the company\u2019s financial condition and operating results \nfor that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. \nfurther, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, \npunitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or \nprofits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the \ncompany that could materially adversely affect its financial condition \nand operating results.while\n the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, \nsuch insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all \ntypes of claims that may arise.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 12the\n company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which \ncould increase the company\u2019s costs and individually or in the aggregate \nadversely affect the company\u2019s business.the\n company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and \ninternational operations in a number of areas.\u00a0these u.s. and \nforeign laws and regulations affect the company\u2019s activities in areas \nincluding, but not limited to, labor, advertising, digital content, \nconsumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, \nquality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and \nmedia, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, \ntax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange \ncontrols and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data \nlocalization requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and \nsafety.by\n way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications \nand media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company \noperates are extensive and subject to change. such changes could \ninclude, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, \ndistribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier\u2019s network,\n or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier\u2019s network. \nthese devices are also subject to certification and regulation by \ngovernmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network \ncarriers for use on their networks.\u00a0these certification processes \nare extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing\n requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment \ndates, or could preclude the company from selling certain products.compliance\n with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous \nand expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to \njurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing \nbusiness. any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of \nchanges in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could \nindividually or in the aggregate make the company\u2019s products and \nservices less attractive to the company\u2019s customers, delay the \nintroduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the \ncompany to change or limit its business practices. the company has \nimplemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with \napplicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the \ncompany\u2019s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws \nand regulations or the company\u2019s policies and procedures.the company\u2019s business is subject to the risks of international operations.the\n company derives a majority of its revenue and earnings from its \ninternational operations. compliance with applicable u.s. and foreign \nlaws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, \nanti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash \nrepatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization \nrequirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition \nregulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign \njurisdictions. although the company has implemented policies and \nprocedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the\n company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur. in\n some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country \ncould violate the laws and regulations of another country. violations of\n these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the \ncompany\u2019s brand, international growth efforts and business.the\n company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated \nwith international activities including, but not limited to, economic \nand labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political\n instability and international trade disputes. gross margins on the \ncompany\u2019s products in foreign countries, and on products that include \ncomponents obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially \nadversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties,\n tariffs and antidumping penalties. the company is also exposed to \ncredit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers \nin certain international markets. there can be no assurance the company \ncan effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.the\n company\u2019s retail stores have required and will continue to require a \nsubstantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to \nnumerous risks and uncertainties.the\n company\u2019s retail stores have required substantial investment in \nequipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and\n personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating \nlease commitments for retail space. certain stores have been designed \nand built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. \nbecause of their unique design elements, locations and size, these \nstores require substantially more investment than the company\u2019s more \ntypical retail stores. due to the high cost structure associated with \nthe company\u2019s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor \nperformance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant\n lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold \nimprovements and severance costs.the\n company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks\n and uncertainties and could adversely impact the company\u2019s financial \ncondition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that \ncould have an adverse effect on general retail activity. other factors \ninclude, but are not limited to, the company\u2019s ability to manage costs \nassociated with retail store construction and operation; manage \nrelationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated \nwith fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew\n leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 13investment\n in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company\u2019s\n ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.the\n company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business \nstrategies or acquisitions. such endeavors may involve significant risks\n and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current \noperations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate \nreturn of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the \ncompany\u2019s due diligence. these new ventures are inherently risky and may\n not be successful.the company\u2019s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.the\n company may be subject to information technology system failures or \nnetwork disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power \ndisruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, \ncomputer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or \ndisruptions. system redundancy and other continuity measures may be \nineffective or inadequate, and the company\u2019s business continuity and \ndisaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. \nsuch failures or disruptions could adversely impact the company\u2019s \nbusiness by, among other things, preventing access to the company\u2019s \nonline services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the \nmanufacturing and shipping of the company\u2019s products. these events could\n materially adversely affect the company\u2019s reputation, financial \ncondition and operating results.there\n may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential \ninformation, including personally identifiable information, that could \nsubject the company to significant reputational, financial, legal and \noperational consequences.the\n company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential \ninformation including, among other things, personally identifiable \ninformation (\u201cpii\u201d) with respect to the company\u2019s customers and \nemployees. the company devotes significant resources to network and data\n security, including through the use of encryption and other security \nmeasures intended to protect its systems and data. but these measures \ncannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to \nor releases of confidential information occur and could materially \nadversely affect the company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and \noperating results.the\n company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information \nwith suppliers and other third parties. although the company takes steps\n to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, \nsuch measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access\n to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially \nadversely affect the company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and \noperating results.for\n example, the company may experience a security breach impacting the \ncompany\u2019s information technology systems that compromises the \nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. \nsuch an incident could, among other things, impair the company\u2019s ability\n to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact \nthe company\u2019s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and\n expose the company to litigation or government investigations, which \ncould result in penalties, fines or judgments against the company.although\n malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential \ninformation, including pii, affect many companies across various \nindustries, the company is at a relatively greater risk of being \ntargeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential \ninformation it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.the\n company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its \ninformation technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or \nloss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and \nauthentication technologies. as with all companies, these security \nmeasures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be \nvulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty\n password management or other irregularities. for example, third parties\n attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing \nuser names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn \nbe used to access the company\u2019s information technology systems. to help \nprotect customers and the company, the company monitors its services and\n systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious \ncircumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or \nloss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company\u2019s \nproducts and services.in\n addition to the risks relating to general confidential information \ndescribed above, the company may also be subject to specific obligations\n relating to health data and payment card data. health data may be \nsubject to additional privacy, security and breach notification \nrequirements, and the company may be subject to audit by governmental \nauthorities regarding the company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. \nif the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and \nrequirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by \nlaw or under the company\u2019s agreements with healthcare institutions, the \ncompany could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may\n be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur \nsignificant fees or fines.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 14under\n payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is \npotentially compromised, the company could be liable for associated \ninvestigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if\n the company fails to follow payment card industry data security \nstandards. the company could also experience a significant increase in \npayment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment \ncards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security \nstandards, which would materially adversely affect the company\u2019s \nreputation, financial condition and operating results.while\n the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address \ncertain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be \ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.the\n company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of u.s. and international \nlaws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.the\n company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to\n the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of pii. in many \ncases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also \nmay restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international \nsubsidiaries. several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and \nother jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. \nthese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction\n to jurisdiction. complying with emerging and changing international \nrequirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require\n the company to change its business practices. noncompliance could \nresult in significant penalties or legal liability.the\n company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through \nits privacy policy, information provided on its website and press \nstatements. any failure by the company to comply with these public \nstatements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related\n or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings \nagainst the company by governmental entities or others. in addition to \nreputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements\n and significant legal liability.the company\u2019s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.much\n of the company\u2019s future success depends on the continued availability \nand service of key personnel, including its chief executive officer, \nexecutive team and other highly skilled employees. experienced personnel\n in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their\n talents is intense, especially in silicon valley, where most of the \ncompany\u2019s key personnel are located.the\n company\u2019s business may be impacted by political events, international \ntrade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues,\n industrial accidents and other business interruptions.political\n events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural \ndisasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\n interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the \nglobal economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the company \nand its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics \nproviders, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel \npartners.international\n trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures\n that could adversely affect the company\u2019s business. tariffs could \nincrease the cost of the company\u2019s products and the components and raw \nmaterials that go into making them. these increased costs could \nadversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its \nproducts. tariffs could also make the company\u2019s products more expensive \nfor customers, which could make the company\u2019s products less competitive \nand reduce consumer demand. countries may also adopt other protectionist\n measures that could limit the company\u2019s ability to offer its products \nand services. political uncertainty surrounding international trade \ndisputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on\n consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the \ncompany\u2019s business.many\n of the company\u2019s operations and facilities as well as critical business\n operations of the company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in\n locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. in\n addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of \ninterruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and\n other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, \nlabor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the \ncompany\u2019s control. global climate change could result in certain types \nof natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense \neffects. such events could make it difficult or impossible for the \ncompany to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create \ndelays and inefficiencies in the company\u2019s supply and manufacturing \nchain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the company\u2019s service \nofferings. following an interruption to its business, the company could \nrequire substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures \nin order to resume operations, and lose significant revenue. because the\n company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and \nmanufacture of many critical components, a business interruption \naffecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the\n company.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 15the\n company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial \naccidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. while the \ncompany\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments \nand operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in \ndisruption to the company\u2019s business and harm to the company\u2019s \nreputation. should major public health issues, including pandemics, \narise, the company could be adversely affected by more stringent \nemployee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight \nservices, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between\n regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in \nthe operations of the company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers.the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.the\n company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic\n segments and distribution channels. for example, gross margins on the \ncompany\u2019s hardware products vary across product lines and can change \nover time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration \nchanges, and component, warranty and other cost fluctuations. the \ncompany\u2019s financial results may be materially adversely impacted as a \nresult of shifts in the mix of products and services that the company \nsells; shifts in the geographic, currency or channel mix of the \ncompany\u2019s sales; component cost increases; price competition; or the \nintroduction of new products, including new products with higher cost \nstructures.the\n company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter\n compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. \nadditionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net \nsales, product costs and operating expenses. further, the company \ngenerates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a \ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly \nnet sales. the company could also be subject to unexpected developments,\n such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the company\u2019s products, \nissues with new product introductions, information technology system \nfailures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the company\u2019s \nlogistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.the company\u2019s stock price is subject to volatility.the\n company\u2019s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in \nthe past and may continue to do so in the future. additionally, the \ncompany, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have \nexperienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have \naffected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these \ncompanies\u2019 operating performance. price volatility over a given period \nmay cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own \nstock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. the company \nbelieves its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth \nand profitability. the company also believes its stock price should \nreflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current \nlevels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be \nfully consummated. future dividends are subject to declaration by the \ncompany\u2019s board of directors, and the company\u2019s share repurchase program\n does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. if the \ncompany fails to meet expectations related to future growth, \nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market \nexpectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could \nhave a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee \nretention.the\n company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with \nchanges in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to local currencies.the\n company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange \nrates relates to non\u2013u.s. dollar\u2013denominated sales and operating \nexpenses worldwide. gross margins on the company\u2019s products in foreign \ncountries and on products that include components obtained from foreign \nsuppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency \nexchange rate fluctuations.weakening\n of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely affects the\n u.s. dollar value of the company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales \nand earnings, and generally leads the company to raise international \npricing, potentially reducing demand for the company\u2019s products. in some\n circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the company may decide\n not to raise international pricing to offset the u.s. dollar\u2019s \nstrengthening, which would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the\n gross margins the company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.conversely,\n a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, \nwhile generally beneficial to the company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated\n sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international \npricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments,\n thereby limiting the benefit. additionally, strengthening of foreign \ncurrencies may increase the company\u2019s cost of product components \ndenominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.the\n company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward \nand option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in \nforeign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may \nnot be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse \nfinancial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates \nover the limited time the hedges are in place.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 16the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.the\n company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit \ndeterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, \npolitical risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other \nfactors. as a result, the value and liquidity of the company\u2019s cash, \ncash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. \ntherefore, although the company has not realized any significant losses \non its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future \nfluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses \nand could have a material adverse impact on the company\u2019s financial \ncondition and operating results.the\n company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, \nvendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply\n agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic \nconditions worsen.the\n company distributes its products through third-party cellular network \ncarriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. the company also sells \nits products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, \nenterprise and government customers. a substantial majority of the \ncompany\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, \nthird-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance.\n the company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade \nreceivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability \nto mitigate such risks may be limited. the company also has unsecured \nvendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by \noutsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies \nor assemble final products for the company. in addition, the company has\n made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure \nsupply of inventory components. as of september\u00a029, 2018,\n a significant portion of the company\u2019s trade receivables was \nconcentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade \nreceivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were \nconcentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia. \nwhile the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit\n risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as \nlong-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will \neffectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.the\n company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of \nnew u.s. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax \nliabilities.the\n company is subject to taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign \njurisdictions, including ireland, where a number of the company\u2019s \nsubsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions, \ntax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change.\n the company\u2019s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the \nmix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes\n in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in \ntax laws or their interpretation, including in the u.s. and ireland.the\n company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other\n tax matters by the u.s. internal revenue service (the \u201cirs\u201d) and other \ntax authorities and governmental bodies. the company regularly assesses \nthe likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations \nto determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. there can be no \nassurance as to the outcome of these examinations. if the company\u2019s \neffective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the u.s. or \nireland, or if the ultimate determination of the company\u2019s taxes owed is\n for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the

u.k. and \nmainland china. the iphone upgrade program provides customers the right \nto trade in that iphone for a specified amount when purchasing a new \niphone, provided certain conditions are met. the company accounts for \nthe trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement \nrevenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to \nthe guarantee liability recognized within revenue.the\n company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors \nand executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed \nto indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law \nagainst liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or\n officers of the company, and to advance expenses incurred by such \nindividuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not \npossible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the \ncompany could be required to make under these agreements due to the \nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and\n circumstances involved in each claim. while the company maintains \ndirectors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance \ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims \nthat may arise.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe\n preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in \nconformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cgaap\u201d) \nand the company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and\n operating results require the company\u2019s management to make judgments, \nassumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its \nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 1, \n\u201csummary of significant accounting policies,\u201d of the notes to \nconsolidated financial statements in part ii, item\u00a08 of this form \n10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in \nthe preparation of the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. \nmanagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various \nother assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, \nthe results of which form the basis for making judgments about the \ncarrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ \nfrom these estimates, and such differences may be material.management\n believes the company\u2019s critical accounting policies and estimates are \nthose related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of \nmarketable securities, inventory valuation, valuation of \nmanufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase commitment \ncancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other \ncontingencies. management considers these policies critical because they\n are both important to the portrayal of the company\u2019s financial \ncondition and operating results, and they require management to make \njudgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. the \ncompany\u2019s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting \npolicies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of\n the company\u2019s board of directors.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 32revenue recognitionnet\n sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software,\n digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support \ncontracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an\n arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or \ndeterminable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered\n to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and \nrewards of ownership have been transferred. for most of the company\u2019s \nproduct sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is \nshipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education \ncustomers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers \nrevenue until the customer receives the product because the company \nretains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. for\n payment terms in excess of the company\u2019s standard payment terms, \nrevenue is recognized as payments become due unless the company has \npositive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as\n a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable \narrangements. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware \nproducts, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the \nfunctionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on \nthe itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition \naccounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with \nindustry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types \nof sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, \n(ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software \nbundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the \nhardware.for\n multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing \nsoftware essential to the hardware product\u2019s functionality, undelivered \nsoftware elements that relate to the hardware product\u2019s essential \nsoftware and/or undelivered non-software services, the company allocates\n revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in \nsuch circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the \nselling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: \n(i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u201cvsoe\u201d), \n(ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u201ctpe\u201d) and \n(iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u201cesp\u201d). vsoe generally exists\n only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price\n actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the \ncompany\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be\n if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.for\n sales of iphone, ipad, mac and certain other products, the company has \nindicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software \nupgrades to the device\u2019s essential software and/or non-software services\n free of charge. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the \nunspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, \nrevenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company\u2019s\n esps. revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and \nnon-software services based on the company\u2019s esps is deferred and \nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the \nsoftware upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.the\n company\u2019s process for determining esps involves management\u2019s judgment \nand considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon \nthe unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. should \nfuture facts and circumstances change, the company\u2019s esps and the future\n rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and \nnon-software services related to future sales of these devices could \nchange. factors subject to change include the unspecified software \nupgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of\n unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services and the \nestimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services\n are expected to be provided.the\n company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related\n to price protection and other customer incentive programs. for \ntransactions involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue \nnet of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount \ncan be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for \nrevenue recognition have been met. the company\u2019s policy requires that, \nif refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until\n reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for the \ncompany\u2019s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is \nrecognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the \nproduct or the date at which the program is offered. the company also \nrecords reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based \non the company\u2019s historical experience. future market conditions and \nproduct transitions may require the company to increase customer \nincentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. \nadditionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to \nestimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive.\n management\u2019s estimates are based on historical experience and the \nspecific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. if a \ngreater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, \nthe company would be required to record additional reductions to \nrevenue, which would have an adverse impact on the company\u2019s operating \nresults.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 33valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe\n company\u2019s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at \nfair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair \nvalue of securities are generally recognized in accumulated other \ncomprehensive income, net of tax, in the company\u2019s consolidated balance \nsheets. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities \nimpact the company\u2019s net income only when such securities are sold or an\n other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and \nlosses on the sale of securities are determined by specific \nidentification of each security\u2019s cost basis. the company regularly \nreviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is \nother-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the company to \nrecord an impairment charge in the period any such determination is \nmade. in making this determination, the company evaluates, among other \nthings, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is\n less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any \nchanges thereto; and the company\u2019s intent to sell, or whether it will \nmore likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery \nof its amortized cost basis. the company\u2019s assessment of whether a \nsecurity is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future \ndue to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any \nparticular security, which would have an adverse impact on the company\u2019s\n financial condition and operating results.inventory valuation, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation feesthe\n company purchases components and builds inventory in advance of product\n shipments and invests in manufacturing-related assets, including \ncapital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities. in addition, the \ncompany makes prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with \nlong-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory. the company \nperforms a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors \nincluding demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product \ndevelopment plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. if \nthe company determines inventories of components and products, including\n third-party products held for resale, have become obsolete or are in \nexcess of anticipated demand or net realizable value, it records a \nwrite-down of the inventories. the company also reviews its \nmanufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for \nimpairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount\n of such assets may not be recoverable. if the company determines that \nan asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the \namount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair \nvalue. any write-downs and/or impairments the company may be required to\n record would adversely affect the company\u2019s financial condition and \noperating results.the\n company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees \nrelated to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to \nbe canceled. manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company\u2019s \nforecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for \nperiods up to 150 days.\n if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more\n of the company\u2019s products, a change in the company\u2019s product \ndevelopment plans, or an unanticipated change in technological \nrequirements for any of the company\u2019s products, the company may be \nrequired to record accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely \naffect its operating results.warranty coststhe\n company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the \nrelated revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty\n claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of \nspecific product failures outside of the company\u2019s typical experience. \nthe company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as\n necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from \nestimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be \nrequired and could materially affect the company\u2019s financial condition \nand operating results.income taxesthe\n company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of\n its reported operating results. the provision for income taxes is \ncomputed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax \nassets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax \nconsequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting \nand tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and \ntax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nmeasured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect \nfor the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to \nbe realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to \nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely \nthan not to be realized.the\n company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it\n is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on \nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of \nthe position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements \nfrom such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that \nhas a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate \nsettlement.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 34management\n believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including \nincome that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning \nstrategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary\n differences, will be sufficient to recover the company\u2019s deferred tax \nassets. in the event that the company determines all or part of its net \ndeferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will \nrecord an adjustment to the valuation allowance and a corresponding \ncharge to earnings in the period such determination is made. in \naddition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant \njudgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of\n gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a \nmanner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material\n impact on the company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.on\n december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the act, which significantly \nchanged u.s. tax law. the act lowered the company\u2019s u.s. statutory \nfederal income tax rate from 35% to 21%\n effective january 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation \ntax on previously deferred foreign income. the act also created a new \nminimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. the impact of the act \nincreased the company\u2019s provision for income taxes by $1.5 billion during 2018. this increase was composed of $2.0 billion related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and $1.2 billion associated with the deemed repatriation tax, partially offset by a $1.7 billion\n impact the deemed repatriation tax had on the company\u2019s unrecognized \ntax benefits. certain amounts reported by the company related to the act\n are provisional estimates in accordance with the sec staff accounting \nbulletin no. 118. resolution of the act\u2019s effects different from the \nassumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the \ncompany\u2019s financial condition and operating results.legal and other contingenciesas\n discussed in part i, item\u00a03 of this form 10-k under the heading \n\u201clegal proceedings\u201d and in part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k in the\n notes to consolidated financial statements in note 9, \u201ccommitments and \ncontingencies,\u201d the company is subject to various legal proceedings and \nclaims that arise in the ordinary course of business. the company \nrecords a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred \nand the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which \nrequires significant judgment. except as described in part ii, item 8 of\n this form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in \nnote 9, \u201ccommitments and contingencies\u201d under the heading \n\u201ccontingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a \nreasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or\n a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss \ncontingencies for asserted legal and other claims.the\n outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. if one or more legal \nmatters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for \namounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, the company\u2019s financial \ncondition and operating results for that reporting period could be \nmaterially adversely affected.item 7a.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate and foreign currency risk managementthe\n company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option \npositions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in \nconjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate \nexposures. given the effective horizons of the company\u2019s risk management\n activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be \nno assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the \nfinancial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or \ninterest rates. further, the recognition of the gains and losses related\n to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and \nlosses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may \nadversely affect the company\u2019s financial condition and operating \nresults.interest rate riskthe\n company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to \nthe company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. while the \ncompany is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the company\u2019s \ninterest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in u.s. \ninterest rates. changes in u.s. interest rates affect the interest \nearned on the company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated \nwith hedging and interest paid on the company\u2019s debt.the\n company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of\n capital and supporting the company\u2019s liquidity requirements. the \ncompany uses a combination of internal and external management to \nexecute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. \nthe company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the \nprimary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. \nthe company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be \ninvestment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one \nissuer. to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk \nassociated with the company\u2019s investment portfolio, the company \nperformed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in \ninterest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio \nassuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. based on \ninvestment positions as of september\u00a029, 2018 and september\u00a030, 2017,\n a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all \nmaturities would result in a $4.9 billion and $6.0 billion incremental \ndecline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. such \nlosses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior \nto maturity.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 35as of september\u00a029, 2018 and september\u00a030, 2017, the company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $102.5 billion and $103.7 billion,\n respectively. the company has entered, and in the future may enter, \ninto interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding\n term debt. interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert\n fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate \npayments into fixed-rate payments. gains and losses on term debt are \ngenerally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related \nhedging instrument. a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates \nwould cause interest expense on the company\u2019s debt as of september\u00a029, 2018 and september\u00a030, 2017 to increase by $399 million and $376 million on an annualized basis, respectively.further\n details regarding the company\u2019s debt is provided in part ii, \nitem\u00a08 of this form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial \nstatements in note 5, \u201cdebt.\u201dforeign currency riskin\n general, the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the \nu.s. dollar. accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a\n strengthening of the u.s. dollar, will negatively affect the company\u2019s \nnet sales and gross margins as expressed in u.s. dollars. there is a \nrisk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing\n due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility\n in foreign currency exchange rates.the\n company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts \nwith financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks \nassociated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly \ncommitted transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments\n in foreign subsidiaries. in addition, the company has entered, and in \nthe future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially \noffset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign \ncurrency\u2013denominated debt issuances. the company generally hedges \nportions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with \nrevenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. however,\n the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures \nfor a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting \nconsiderations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular \nexposures.to\n provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated\n with certain of the company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, \nthe company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk \n(\u201cvar\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange\n rates. the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to \ngenerate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market \nconditions. the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a \ngiven confidence interval, to the company\u2019s foreign currency derivative \npositions due to adverse movements in rates. the var model is not \nintended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and\n management tool. forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets \nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the\n model. based on the results of the model, the company estimates with \n95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $592 million as \nof september\u00a029, 2018 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $485 million as of september\u00a030, 2017.\n because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging \npurposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are \ngenerally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying \nexposures.actual\n future gains and losses associated with the company\u2019s investment \nportfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the \nsensitivity analyses performed as of september\u00a029, 2018\n due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing \nand amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates\n and the company\u2019s actual exposures and positions.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k |

wholesalers, retailers \nand resellers. in addition, the company sells a variety of third-party \napple-compatible products, including application software and various \naccessories, through its

consolidated financial statements include the accounts of \nthe company. intercompany accounts and transactions have been \neliminated. in the opinion of the company\u2019s management, the consolidated\n financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and \nrecurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement \npresentation. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements\n and accompanying notes in conformity with u.s. generally accepted \naccounting principles (\u201cgaap\u201d) requires management to make estimates and\n assumptions that affect the amounts reported. actual results could \ndiffer materially from those estimates. certain prior period amounts in \nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been \nreclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation.the\n company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the \nlast saturday of september. the company\u2019s fiscal years 2018 and 2016 \nspanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. a \n14th week was included in the first fiscal quarter of 2017, as is done \nevery five or six years, to realign the company\u2019s fiscal quarters with \ncalendar quarters. unless otherwise stated, references to particular \nyears, quarters, months and periods refer to the company\u2019s fiscal years \nended in september and the associated quarters, months and periods of \nthose fiscal years.revenue recognitionnet\n sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software,\n digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support \ncontracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an\n arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or \ndeterminable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered\n to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and \nrewards of ownership have been transferred. for most of the company\u2019s \nproduct sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is \nshipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education \ncustomers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers \nrevenue until the customer receives the product because the company \nretains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. for\n payment terms in excess of the company\u2019s standard payment terms, \nrevenue is recognized as payments become due unless the company has \npositive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as\n a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable \narrangements. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware \nproducts, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the \nfunctionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on \nthe itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition \naccounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with \nindustry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types \nof sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, \n(ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software \nbundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the \nhardware.for\n the sale of most third-party products, the company recognizes revenue \nbased on the gross amount billed to customers because the company \nestablishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory\n risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and \nassumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. for \nthird-party applications sold through the app store and mac app store \nand certain digital content sold through the itunes store, the company \ndoes not determine the selling price of the products and is not the \nprimary obligor to the customer. therefore, the company accounts for \nsuch sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the \ncommission it retains from each sale. the portion of the gross amount \nbilled to customers that is remitted by the company to third-party app \ndevelopers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the \ncompany\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 43the\n company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance \nof the delivery of products or the performance of services. this \nincludes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified \nsoftware upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to \nhardware and software products. the company sells gift cards redeemable \nat its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on\n itunes store, app store, mac app store, tv app store and book store for\n the purchase of digital content and software. the company records \ndeferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon \nredemption of the card by the customer. revenue from applecare service \nand support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service \ncoverage periods. applecare service and support contracts typically \ninclude extended phone support, repair services, web-based support \nresources and diagnostic tools offered under the company\u2019s standard \nlimited warranty.the\n company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related\n to price protection and other customer incentive programs. for \ntransactions involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue \nnet of the estimated amount to be refunded. for the company\u2019s other \ncustomer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is \nrecognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the \nproduct or the date at which the program is offered. the company also \nrecords reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based \non the company\u2019s historical experience. revenue is recorded net of taxes\n collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities,\n with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted\n to the relevant government authority.revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverablesfor\n multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing \nsoftware essential to the hardware product\u2019s functionality, undelivered \nsoftware elements that relate to the hardware product\u2019s essential \nsoftware, and undelivered non-software services, the company allocates \nrevenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in \nsuch circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the \nselling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: \n(i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u201cvsoe\u201d), \n(ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u201ctpe\u201d) and \n(iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u201cesp\u201d). vsoe generally exists\n only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price\n actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the \ncompany\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be\n if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. for multi-element \narrangements accounted for in accordance with industry-specific software\n accounting guidance, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables \nbased on the vsoe of each element,

individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law \nagainst liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or\n officers of the company, and to advance expenses incurred by such \nindividuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not \npossible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the \ncompany could be required to make under these agreements

most components essential to the company\u2019s business are generally \navailable from multiple sources, certain components are currently \nobtained from single or limited sources. in addition, the company \ncompetes for various components with other participants in the markets \nfor mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. \ntherefore, many components used by the company, including those that are\n available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could \nmaterially adversely affect the company\u2019s financial condition and \noperating results.apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 60the\n company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its \ncompetitors, and new products introduced by the company often utilize \ncustom components available from only one source. when a component or \nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist \nuntil the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has \nincreased. if the company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing \nproduct were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner \ndelayed shipments of completed products to the company, the company\u2019s \nfinancial condition and operating results could be materially adversely \naffected. the company\u2019s business and financial performance could also be\n materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain \nsufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and \nobtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued \navailability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be\n affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common\n components instead of components customized to meet the company\u2019s \nrequirements.the\n company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; \nhowever, there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to \nextend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. therefore,\n the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages \nand price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial\n condition and operating results.substantially\n all of the company\u2019s hardware

\nmanufacturers for many of the company\u2019s products. although the company \nworks closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, \nthe company\u2019s financial condition and operating results could be \nmaterially adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to\n meet their production commitments. the company\u2019s manufacturing purchase\n obligations

maintaining effective internal \ncontrol over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the \neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in \nthe accompanying

regarding the reliability of \nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for \nexternal purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting \nprinciples. a company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting \nincludes those policies and procedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the \nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\n reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\n necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance \nwith u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts \nand expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with \nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and \n(3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely \ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the \ncompany\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial \nstatements.because\n of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting \nmay not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any \nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk \nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or\n that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \ndeteriorate./s/ ernst & young llpsan jose, californianovember\u00a05, 2018apple inc. | 2018 form 10-k | 66item 9.changes in and disagreements with accountants on

\nthe company\u2019s management, the company\u2019s principal executive officer and \nprincipal financial officer have concluded that the company\u2019s disclosure\n controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) \nunder the exchange act were effective as of september\u00a029, 2018\n to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be \ndisclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the \nexchange act is (i)\u00a0recorded, processed, summarized and reported \nwithin the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms and \n(ii)\u00a0accumulated and communicated to the company\u2019s management, \nincluding its principal executive officer and principal financial \nofficer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required \ndisclosure.inherent limitations over internal controlsthe\n company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to \nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial \nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external \npurposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting \nprinciples (\u201cgaap\u201d). the company\u2019s internal control over financial \nreporting includes those policies and procedures that:\u00a0(i)pertain\n to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately \nand fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company\u2019s \nassets;(ii)provide\n reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to \npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap, and \nthat the company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in \naccordance with authorizations of the company\u2019s management and \ndirectors; and(iii)provide\n reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of \nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets \nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.management,\n including the company\u2019s chief executive officer and chief financial \nofficer, does not expect that the company\u2019s internal controls will \nprevent or detect all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter \nhow well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not \nabsolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. \nfurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there\n are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be \nconsidered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations \nin all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide \nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if \nany, have been detected. also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of \ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal \ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in business \nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or \nprocedures may deteriorate.management\u2019s annual report on internal control over financial reportingthe\n company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining \nadequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule \n13a-15(f) under the exchange act). management conducted an assessment of\n the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control over financial \nreporting based on the criteria set forth in internal control \u2013 \nintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations\n of the treadway commission (2013 framework). based on the company\u2019s \nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over \nfinancial reporting was effective as of september\u00a029, 2018\n to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial \nreporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with\n gaap. the company\u2019s
